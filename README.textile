h1. dotfiles

Originally based of InfiniteRed's dotfiles but things has been adjusted since then.


h2. File and directory structure

I store all my command-line files in a folder (projects/dotfiles), then under that folder there are 3 sub-folders (bin, etc, doc), to keep them organized away from all my other files.  I link (etc/link) the dot files to the root of my home folder, so I prefer to store them without the . (for example, gitignore instead of .gitignore), then I add the dot in the link.  So if you use one, make sure you put the dot back.

  * ~
  ** projects
  *** dotfiles
  **** bin
  **** docs
  **** etc
  ***** vim
          
h2. Warning

I mod these all the time, and sometimes I break stuff.  Also, my main platforms are OS X and Linux (Debian based) in the console, not XWindows.  Most of my stuff works just fine in something like gnome-terminal, but I usually only check my main platforms when I make changes.
